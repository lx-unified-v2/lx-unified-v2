# Unified Bibliography Style for Linguistics Journals, version 2

This is the collaboration site of a group working on a updated, amended, precisified version of the [Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics Journal](http://celxj.org/downloads/UnifiedStyleSheet.pdf) from January 7, 2007. The stylesheet was developed by [CELxJ, the Committee of Editors of Linguistics Journals](http://celxj.org/). 

There is a standard BibTeX implementation, called [`unified.bst`](http://celxj.org/downloads/unified.bst), which was developed by Bridget Samuels, based on work done for the house-style (`sp.bst`) of the journal [*Semantics and Pragmatics (S&P)*](http://semprag.org). S&P has since moved to a biblatex implementation of the stylesheet, hosted on github as [biblatex-sp-unified](https://github.com/semprag/biblatex-sp-unified).

Using the stylesheet in the production of articles for S&P has revealed several issues that the new version will hope to address. Other stakeholders are also involved in the revision. Some modifications to be discussed were proposed by Martin Haspelmath in the [Generic Style Rules for Linguistics](http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/past-research-resources/resources/generic-style-rules.html). Others arose in the work on `biblatex-sp-unified`. Yet more will arise as we work on the new version.

The main work in the group will occur in [the "Issues" discussion](https://github.com/lx-unified-v2/lx-unified-v2/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue) of this github repository. The outcome will be a revised version 2 stylesheet to be used in various contexts and hopefully to be adopted by other publishers.
